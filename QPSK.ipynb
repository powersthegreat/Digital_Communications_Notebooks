    "Matched filtering is a pulse compression technique employed to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the received signal, enhancing the detection of the transmitted symbols in the presence of noise. This technique involves filtering the received signal with the time-reversed and complex conjugate of the pulse shape used during transmission. For this example, the matched filter corresponds to the previously defined square root raised cosine (SRRC) filter.\n",

    "The primary advantage of matched filtering is that it optimizes the SNR at the sampling instants, which is critical for accurate symbol detection. By correlating the received signal with the expected pulse shape, the matched filter effectively compresses the energy of each symbol into a narrow peak at the symbol timing, while simultaneously minimizing the impact of noise and intersymbol interference (ISI) from adjacent symbols. This process is represented mathmatically below.\n",
