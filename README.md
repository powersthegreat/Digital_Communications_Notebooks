## Digital Communications Jupyter Library

### Introduction

This library provides a comprehensive collection of Jupyter Notebooks focused on Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) and related topics in digital communication systems. It includes both transmitter and receiver architectures, beginning with assumed synchronization and culminating in a fully coherent transmission system. This library is designed to help you understand and implement key concepts in QAM systems, including phase modulation and timing synchronization.

### Features

- **QPSK.ipynb:** A simple Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) digital communication system, focusing on the fundamental components of transmitter and receiver architectures.
- **PLL.ipynb:** A digital Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) implementation, building into full integration and simulation within a QPSK receiver.
- **SCS.ipynb:** A digital Symbol Clock Synchronizer (SCS) subsystem implementation, building into full integration and simulation within a QPSK receiver.
- **QPSK_Synchronized.ipynb:** A fully coherent QPSK transmission system, including both PLL and SCS subsystems integration.
- **CORDiC.ipynb:** Explanation and use cases of the coordinate rotation digital computer algorithm.

### Getting Started

To get started with the Jupyter Notebook Library:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/powersthegreat/Digital_Communications_Notebooks
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies:** Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your system. The Jupyter package can be installed via the following command (will take up to a minute):
   ```bash
   pip install notebook
   ```
3. **Run the Notebooks:** Launch Jupyter Notebook and open any notebook of your choice to start learning and experimenting.
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
